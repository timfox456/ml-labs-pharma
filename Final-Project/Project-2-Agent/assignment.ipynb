    "# Final Project 2: Drug Review Analysis Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Your goal is to build an AI agent that can perform a complex, multi-step analysis of a drug review dataset. This project goes \"Beyond RAG\" by requiring the LLM to act as a reasoning engine that uses tools to gather information and synthesize a final answer.\n",

    "**Estimated Time:** 1 hour\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Task:** You will create a set of Python functions that act as \"tools\" for an agent. You will then build a LangChain agent that can use these tools to answer a multi-hop question that a simple RAG system could not handle.\n",
