92703,Lybrel,Birth Control,"I used to take another oral contraceptive, which had 21 pill cycle, and was very happy- very light periods, max 5 days, no other side effects.

I'm on my third week and I love it!",10,03-Nov-15

I am on 10mg. I am no longer depressed and have no anxiety. My doctor will be taking me off of the Zoloft soon.

I am so grateful for this medication.",10,14-Mar-15
