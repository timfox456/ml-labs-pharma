    "# Final Project 3: Clinical Trial Report Parser\n",

    "**Objective:** Your goal is to build a robust system that can extract structured information from unstructured text using an LLM with **function calling**. This is a highly valuable skill for turning messy, real-world documents into clean, database-ready data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Estimated Time:** 1 hour\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Task:** You will define a Pydantic schema for the data you want to extract from clinical trial press releases. Then, you will use LangChain and OpenAI's function calling ability to parse the text and populate your schema.\n",
