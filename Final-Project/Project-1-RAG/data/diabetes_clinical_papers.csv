1,"Metformin in type 2 diabetes: a review of its efficacy and safety","Metformin is a cornerstone of therapy for type 2 diabetes. This review summarizes the extensive evidence supporting its efficacy in glycemic control, its favorable safety profile, and its potential cardiovascular benefits. We discuss its mechanism of action, including the reduction of hepatic glucose production and improvement of insulin sensitivity."
2,"Cardiovascular Outcomes with Liraglutide in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes","In this randomized trial, we assigned patients with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk to receive either liraglutide or placebo. The primary composite outcome was the first occurrence of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. Liraglutide treatment resulted in a significantly lower risk of the primary outcome than placebo."
3,"Empagliflozin, Cardiovascular Outcomes, and Mortality in Type 2 Diabetes","The EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial investigated the effect of empagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes. Patients receiving empagliflozin had a significantly lower rate of the primary composite cardiovascular outcome and of death from any cause than those in the placebo group."
4,"Insulin Glargine versus Standard Care in High-Risk Glycemic Control","This study compared the effects of insulin glargine with standard care on cardiovascular outcomes. While insulin glargine effectively controlled glucose levels, it did not significantly reduce the rate of cardiovascular events compared with standard care over a median of 6.2 years."
5,"The role of GLP-1 Receptor Agonists in weight management for diabetic patients","GLP-1 receptor agonists, such as liraglutide and semaglutide, have shown significant benefits not only for glycemic control but also for weight loss. This paper reviews the mechanisms through which these agents promote satiety and reduce body weight, making them a valuable option for overweight or obese patients with type 2 diabetes."
